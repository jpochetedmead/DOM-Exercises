<!-- Ch 02 - Looping A Triangle:  Solve the exercise as before,
but instead of logging each line to the console
create a paragraph element and add it to the document inside in the body element. -->
<!-- Ch 02 - Chessboard: Create a chessboard like before, but add elements to the page instead of logging a string.
Instead of ` ` and # characters, create <div> elements that are styled to be squares and alternate between red and black backgrounds.
  You'll have to figure out which styles can be done simply with CSS and which need to be updated with JavaScript.
  The chessboard should be created using a function at the end of the script so we can pass an argument to control the size, like chessboard(8). -->
